    "1. Runs a full 3-rater simulation on 15 platforms × 3 dimensions (O, R, α)\n",
    "2. Sweeps κ from 0.20 to 0.90 across all three dimensions\n",
    "3. Shows which κ thresholds unlock which Spearman levels\n",
    "4. Outputs the **scoring protocol** — exact rubric for each dimension (0–3)\n",
